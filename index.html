        <div class="Paragraphs">
        <p>"Timothy came to our group with book knowledge of IT concepts. He worked extremely hard, soaked up knowledge like a sponge. He is very dedicated, always at work on time or early, and always in a good mood and ready for a new challenge. I have never had an intern work harder than Timothy does. He will be an asset to any company that is lucky enough to have him as an employee. His skills have grown from book intelligence to hands on learning of the inner workings of a Datacenter, working with servers from unboxing to the complete opposite OS install process. There is nothing that Timothy could be given for work that he was unable to complete."<br/> - David Barnette, Systems Administrator, Life Care Centers of America</p>

            <p>I love new challenges, working with numbers, and have a passion for the continually changing
                IT world. I am open for any IT or accounting related positions with any company as passionate
                about their work as I am. For more information, be sure and take a look around and fill out the
